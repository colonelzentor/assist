# Aircraft Sizing, Synthesis and Integration Support Tool (ASSIST)

This tool is meant to be a quick and general conceptual design tool for aeronautical engineering students and professionals.

The goal of this tool is not to become as complex as other more advanced aircraft design tools (such as NASA's Flight Optimization System (FLOPS)) but remain a light-weight and simple application that can provide that initial conceptual analysis capability in the very early stages of the design process.

All methods and data used in this program have been described in the references listed below.
